1. Introduction
    The SuperpyMarket Management Tool is a command-line application aimed at helping store managers efficiently manage their inventory, sales, and reports. It offers features like buying and selling products, generating reports on inventory, revenue, and profit, and even time manipulation for testing purposes.

    1. Download application files:

        Unlike traditional installers, this application does not come with an installer. You will need to set it up manually.

    3. Install required dependency:

        To install the "rich" package, open your terminal and execute the following command:

            $ pip install rich

        The other modules are part of the standard Python library.

    4. Run the application:

        Open your terminal and and navigate to the directory where you've placed the application files.

    3.3 Generating Reports
        Generate reports on inventory, revenue, and profit using the following command:
