For this requirement:
    Two other additional non-trivial features of your choice, I've used:
        • The use of an external module Rich to improve the application.
        • The ability to import/export reports from/to formats other than CSV (in addition to CSV). (JSON)

Please include a short, 300-word report that highlights three technical elements of your implementation that you find notable.
Explain what problem they solve and why you chose to implement them in this way.

Inventory Management:
    The first technical element is the dynamic inventory management, achieved through the report_inventory function. 
    This function calculates the inventory count of products based on both purchase and sales records, considering various date ranges.
    This approach solves the challenge of maintaining an accurate inventory count by considering products bought and sold over time. 
    By adapting to varying conditions such as dates and product attributes, this dynamic inventory management ensures that users receive an up-to-date representation of their stock.

Identification of Product IDs:
    The second technical element is the solution to utilize both used_ids and new_ids sets to manage product IDs effectively. 
    This approach solves the problem of generating unique IDs for purchased items while avoiding conflicts and ensuring consistency. 
    By maintaining a record of used IDs and generating new ones as needed, the application prevents the accidental reuse of IDs.
    This implementation choice guarantees data integrity and mitigates potential errors in the identification process.

"Time Travel" and Date Handling:
    The third technical element is the time travel functionality achieved through the "advance-time" and "set-current-time" commands.
    This feature addresses the challenge of simulating changes in time for testing or retrospective analysis.
    The "advance-time" command lets users travel forward or backward in time, adjusting the current date accordingly.
    This capability aids in testing scenarios involving future or past dates without altering the system's actual date.
    The "set-current-time" command lets users reset the system's date to the current date, useful for returning to real-time operations after the "time travel".
    This approach enhances the versatility of the application, enabling to explore various scenarios without affecting the actual timeline.
